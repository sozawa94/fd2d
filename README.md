2D dynamic rupture simulation codes using spatio-temporal Boundary Integral Equation Method.
Based on the following paper:

Ando, Ryosuke, Nobuki Kame, and Teruo Yamashita. "An efficient boundary integral equation method applicable to the analysis of non-planar fault dynamics." Earth, planets and space 59.5 (2007): 363-373.

planar.f90: inplane planar with slip weakening friction
nonplanar.f90: mode2 arbitrary shape with slip weakening friction
rsf.f90: mode2 arbitrary shape with rate and state friction

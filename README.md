2D dynamic rupture simulation codes using BIEM

planar.f90: inplane planar (using fftw for convolution) with slip weakening friction
nonplanar.f90: mode2 arbitrary shape with slip weakening friction
rsf.f90: mode2 arbitrary shape with rate and state friction
rsfs.f90: prototype for Dynamic & Quasi-dynamic coupling for cycle
